Excel-based sentiment analysis of clothing product reviews using NLP techniques.

Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews (Excel NLP Project)

This project demonstrates a simple but effective approach to sentiment analysis using Microsoft Excel. It analyzes customer reviews of a clothing product to determine whether the sentiment is Positive, Negative, or Neutral using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Project Overview

- Collected customer review data
- Cleaned and preprocessed the text (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase)
- Tokenized reviews into words
- Counted word frequencies
- Built a Term-Document Matrix (TDM) to map important keywords
- Assigned sentiment labels based on keyword presence
- Summarized insights for quick understanding

All steps are fully documented in the Excel file.

‚úÖ How It Works

1. Load raw customer reviews into Excel  
2. Clean the text (lowercase conversion, punctuation removal)  
3. Tokenize reviews into individual words  
4. Count frequency of sentiment-laden words  
5. Build a Term-Document Matrix (TDM) mapping keywords to reviews  
6. Assign sentiment labels based on positive/negative word counts  
7. Summarize results for easy interpretation

üìà Example Insight

- Reviews with more positive keywords (e.g., "amazing", "excellent") were labeled **Positive**
- Reviews with negative words (e.g., "poor", "worst") were labeled **Negative**
- Mixed or neutral reviews were labeled **Neutral**
